# Getting Started with Orama

Orama is an **immutable, runtime-agnostic, edge, and in-memory full-text search engine** that works both on client and server.

Through implementing an optimized prefix tree and some clever tweaks, Orama can perform searches through millions of entries in **microseconds**.

## Requirements

A JavaScript runtime is the **only** requirement. Orama has been designed to work on any runtime and has no dependencies.

## Installation

You can install Orama using npm, yarn, pnpm:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
  <Tab>```bash npm install @orama/orama ```</Tab>
  <Tab>```bash yarn add @orama/orama ```</Tab>
  <Tab>```bash pnpm add @orama/orama ```</Tab>
</Tabs>

Or import it directly in a browser module:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <script type="module">
      import { create, search, insert } from 'https://unpkg.com/@oramasearch/orama@latest/dist/index.js'

      // ...
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

# CommonJS Imports

Orama ships **ESM** modules by default. This allows us to move faster when providing new features and bug fixes, as well as using the `"exports"` field in `package.json` to provide a better developer experience.

CommonJS imports are still supported, but you'll need to import Lyra from `@orama/orama/cjs` instead of `@orama/orama`:

```diff
- const { search, insert, create } = require("@orama/orama");
+ const { search, insert, create } = require("@orama/orama/cjs");
```

## TypeScript

Set `moduleResolution` in the `compilerOptions` in your `tsconfig.json` to be either `Node16` or `NodeNext`.

When importing types, always refer to the standard lyra import:

```ts
import type { Language } from '@orama/orama'
```
