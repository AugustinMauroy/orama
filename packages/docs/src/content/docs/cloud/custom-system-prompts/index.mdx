Custom System Prompts in Orama allow you to define custom instructions that shape how the AI engine responds to users. These prompts can be tailored for various use cases, such as altering the tone of the AI, introducing information that isn’t in the data sources, or directing users toward specific actions.

For example, if a user asks about pricing, a system prompt could instruct the AI to suggest visiting a website for details instead of providing a direct answer. You could also include context like software versions or other specialized information to ensure more accurate responses. The flexibility of System Prompts enables you to mold the assistant’s behavior to meet your specific needs.

## Best Practices and Limitations

While System Prompts give you powerful control over the AI’s behavior, they are subject to certain validation rules to maintain safety and efficiency. Orama has implemented jailbreak protection to guard against malicious or harmful actions. There are also limits on the length and complexity of prompts to ensure optimal performance.

These safeguards ensure that while you have the freedom to shape the AI’s responses, the assistant will always behave in a reliable, secure, and efficient manner.
